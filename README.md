Karaoke Roulette!

Team Members:     
Charles McCarthy, Edwin Rodriguez, Lauren Farrell

Project Description: 
Karaoke Roulette! A fun game of karaoke with a twist – players get to sing 15 seconds of three random songs!  Lyrics are displayed on the screen as the random song plays. Viewers get to rate the singers via a live Twitter Feed and/or firebase emoji votes!

Development Inspiration
As a team we wanted to create an app that was fun, entertaining, and social. Instead of inventing a new game we wanted to come up with an app that was sort of a “plugin” to an already existing activity people do that they find fun, entertaining and social – something you can do at home or when out with friends.

Technology Used: 
YouTube API
Twitter API Widget
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
Firebase
User Validation Input
Heroku
Javascript/JQuery

**Run heroku app without the https or else firebase will not work
